CLASS 1
Note from Joana's presentation

Choreography is joana’s main concept. both in physical and digital spaces - writing space, writing movement. Ingredients: space and time
Also: hacking space/time
critically engaging with tools and finding her place in graphic design. Some examples now:
looking at the ‘head’ and ‘body’ of google search web page and changing the source code through the web console. Informating ‘dancing’ in front of you, different rhythms of information. Friction between designing for machines (quicker!) and designing for humans.
Language: mainly JavaScript, injected with choreographic concepts. She creates micro-dances within web environments. 
Studied classical dance, tango, buto and different kinds of modern dance. The field of dance is also connected to cybernetics and control systems. 
Not free movement, but constrained movement. 
This performance happened at V2, here in Witte de With in Rotterdam [suspense music…]
Unity + web browser extension happening in realtime = live coding as a different mode of navigtation. 
This is a rotating google page [very strange alien sounds]. how do we feed ourselves with glitches.
collaboration with different artists.
current research on machine learning algorithms. What different patterns can be found?
Concern: the tools of research are already biased!
As graphic designers, aware how our tools shape information and accessibility. 
Example: online residency, coding with google maps that morph in front of you. 

All these texts are choreographic codes, with words that speak about movement and bodies. 
When we meet next week, there will be a workshop on appropriating choregraphic scores as a political device. 

The role of the body: even the digital has a physical impact. The digital is not displaced. Things are not in the cloud, they are grounded and come back to the BODY. 

I asked her to show the anatomy of a website.
opening the web console
the ‘head’ contains action script (like the human brain, meta information that sets things in action)
the ‘body’ is the skeleton are different components, the logo, the elements. 
even in web page split between thinking head and action movement, as if the body could operate separately. mind-body split is pervasive, Cartesian divide is something I’m fighting against. We can’t live as a head without a body. 
First thing we do in a web page is chopping head and body.
